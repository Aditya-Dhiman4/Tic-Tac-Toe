# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic tac toe game coded in Python, using Pygame.

Instructions:
  Click any box to colour it in, starts off with green (in this case instead of X's and O's I used the colours Green and Red)
  ***Do not click the border or your turn will skip***
  After a winner is decided, close the window and re-run the program. A restart function will be added later.
